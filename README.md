# Layouts

This repo uses [Kalamine](https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/kalamine) and
github actions to produce version-controlled layouts for my use cases.

# Can't reuse (everything)

This repo intentionally doesn't have licenses on things that I don't know how
to deal with yet, how to deal with layouts I didn't create. Once I have a
better idea, I'll see.
