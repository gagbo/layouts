# Layouts

This repo uses [Kalamine](https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/kalamine) and
github actions to produce version-controlled layouts for my use cases.

## TODO

- [ ] Put generated layouts in repo so I can patch them directly
- [ ] Don't use qwerty location when Ctrl/System is active
- [ ] Make an angle-mod version of the layouts
- [ ] Patch kalamine to allow
  + [ ] Defining our own dead key layers like the predefined ones
  + [ ] Having dead keys behind other dead-keys
    - [x] MacOS: use the <next = ...> config in the action field
    - [ ] Windows:
    - [ ] Linux:
